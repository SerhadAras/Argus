> Argus: the "all-seeing" primordial giant

<br>

Argus was a responsibility given to the students of "Security Project", a course at AP Hogeschool. <br>
The idea is to create a highly available, agile platform to execute checks that control a given domain or ip address.
We realised this by using different microservices that can be easily deployed with ansible scripts and dockerfiles.
A high selling point of our platform is the use of a Kubernetes cluster, which ensures the autoscaling of all services. <br>
This project is created with a security mindset, but can be used for other (non-security) purposes. The principle of "plug 'n play" is a definite here,
just remove / add / replace the checks with your own scripts and you're good to go.<br>
For more details about what lives in the environment, we refer you to our [wiki page](https://github.com/WatcherWhale/SecProA/wiki).<br>

<br>

## Available Checklists
A list of all checklists included:
| Name          | Description    |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| IP            | Does the GEOIP test, checks if ipv6 is supported and runs your ip against blocklists. |
| DNS           | Checks if DNSSEC is present and enabled. |
| Mail          | Gives scores based on the presence of 3 specific records: DKIM, DMARC AND SPF.|
| HTTPS         | Checks if there is a redirection from http to https, if there is a valid certificate present and what TLS version is supported. |
| Cookie        | Checks the website for illegal use of third party cookies according to the GDPR. |
| Headers       | Reads the headers looking for faulty or absent security headers. |
| Vulnerability | Looks for critical infrastructure on the outside with shodan and checks if there are CVEs found on the outside of the domain. |
